Assessing an LLM qualitatively on a specific use case is a manual and time-consuming task because one needs to evaluate the model based on hundreds of questions. This is highly subjective and requires reading hundreds of answers and comparing them with the ground truth answer. Therefore, to overcome this problem and reduce the manual work associated with assessing the quality of response, we propose RAQ.
